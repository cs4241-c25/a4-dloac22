I converted the frontend from HTML & TailwindCSS to React and Bootstrap as this assignment required using React components, I tried to use TailwindCSS as well but I got some issues while installing the init TailWindCSS so I changed to Bootstrap. The backend uses Node.js, Express, and MongoDB same as Assignment 3.
